5 Streptomyces genomes

1. Streptomyces lavendulae (P5)
2. Streptomyces albus (DSM 40763)
3. Streptomyces galilaeus (S.gal)
4. Streptomyces sp. H021 (H021)
5. Streptomyces ? (PGAG4)

# Culture:
GYM medium + 0.5% glycine

# Extraction:
1. Modified protocol of "High yield preparation of genomic DNA from Streptomyces" Nikodinovic et. al. 2003
2. Quantification via fluorometry following "Protocol for high-sensitivity/long linear-range spectrofluorimetric DNA quantification using ethidium bromide" Bonasera et. al. 2007

# Sequencing:
Libraries created and sequenced at Eurofins
(Illumina MiSeq v3 300bp PE reads)

# Assembly:
a5 MiSeq (v20150522)
(adapter trimming, quality filtering, error correction, contig and scaffold generation, and detection of misassembllies)

# Evaluation:
1. PhyloSift or BUSCO for completeness
2. REAPR for accuracy
